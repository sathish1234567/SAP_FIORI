Get Entity Set: for multiple same property values
__________________

When you are passing different fields as part of Filter parameters you need to use AND only ( which is as below as per your URL )

?$filter=Customer eq '32' and Name eq 'AT'



When you want to pass multiple values for the same fields as part of Filter parameters you can use OR in combination with AND as below



?$filter=( Customer eq '32' or Customer eq '33' ) and ( Name eq 'AT' or Name eq 'BT' )



?$filter=( Customer eq '32' or Customer eq '33' )



?$filter=( Name eq 'AT' or Name eq 'BT' )
